Overview
This project explores VR interaction mechanisms, focusing on implementing and refining proximity triggers and sound-based UI elements. The primary interactions include proximity-based triggers for activating UI components and a sound bar adjustment using VR controls.

Core Interactions
Proximity Triggers
This feature includes a proximity-based activation system for game elements, with one of the triggers using the player's hand and hand colliders to detect interactions. For this specific trigger, the button only activates after the user holds their hand over it for a short period, adding a deliberate, timed interaction.

Sound Bar Adjustment
A slider UI for adjusting sound levels, ideal for rhythm games or mini-games, introduces an interactive sound adjustment element within the VR environment.

Versions Implemented
Version 1
Basic proximity trigger detection, where proximity actions are initiated by the player's hand or controller within range of the sensor.

Version 2
Added adjustments based on initial feedback, including trigger height and sensitivity. Additionally, the hand-based trigger was refined to require the user to hold their hand within range for a short duration before activation, creating a more intentional interaction. The sound bar was also improved for smoother, more responsive adjustments.

User Testing: Observations and Reflections
Testing revealed that interactions with proximity triggers generally met user expectations, though some tweaks were necessary. For example, users suggested raising certain triggers for comfort, and others highlighted the value of consistent trigger sensitivity.

Key Takeaways
Trigger Height and Sensitivity: Adjustments to the trigger height improved access, reducing issues with responsiveness.
Hand-Hold Mechanism: The hold-based trigger was well-received for adding realism to the interaction, though it required fine-tuning to detect the hold duration precisely.
Application Suggestions: Users felt that proximity triggers and sound adjustments would be particularly suited to puzzle, horror, and rhythm games, adding immersive elements and soundscapes.
VR Experience Levels: Users of all experience levels interacted similarly with the triggers, though less-experienced users noted a learning curve with the hand-hold trigger.
